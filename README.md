Interactive API Mock for webapp development

## Background
I just wanted to learn about Elm and Service Workers. Also I spend a lot of time trying to reproduce
obscure edge cases that can happen when consuming an HTTP API, and I figured out being able to
interactively build an API mock could be fun. So I started building this. No idea if it will end up
anywhere ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
